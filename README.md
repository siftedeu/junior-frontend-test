# Junior Frontend Test

Hey there, thank you for applying!

## Getting started

To clone this repo, in terminal please enter:
```
git clone https://github.com/siftedeu/junior-frontend-test.git
```

Once it's done doing its thing, you should now have a copy of the files and folders you'll be working with!

**Please note:** We haven't included any framework or expect you to use one yourself, it's all vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This means all you need to do get this project running is double-clicking `index.html`. Doing so should open up your default browser and allow you to view the contents of the code we've set up.

## The task

We want to see how well you are able to take a design and turn it into a functioning piece of code. In order to do so we're providing you a [design file](https://www.figma.com/file/lYwdJxRgjCwHlSmxxTtaFG/Sifted-FE-Tech-Test-Junior) that contains something that resembles a pricing page (please feel free to send us a message if you're having trouble with our design software of choice, being able to use it is **NOT** part of the test).

1. Given the design, we would like you to build it out with responsive design in mind. We've provided what we expect it should look like on mobile, tablet and desktop in the [design file](https://www.figma.com/file/lYwdJxRgjCwHlSmxxTtaFG/Sifted-FE-Tech-Test-Junior) to help guide you.

2. Next, we would like you to add some interactivity to the page using JavaScript. You'll have noticed the pricing toggle in the design, we want this to change prices on the page from monthly values to yearly and vice versa depending on which option is selected. There's no discounts to worry about, so please simply multiply the values provided in the [design file](https://www.figma.com/file/lYwdJxRgjCwHlSmxxTtaFG/Sifted-FE-Tech-Test-Junior) accordingly.

**Please note:** while we've only included a single CSS and JavaScript file respectively, you are free to create more should you want. You are allowed to modify the code we have provided in any way you would like!

## What we are looking for

_General_

_HTML/CSS_
- Sensible HTML structure
- Good use of CSS Grids and/or Flexbox where applicable
- Well structured and clean CSS (good use of classes, sensible naming and so on)

_JavaScript_
- Good understanding of the basics
- A decent grasp of JavaScript event handlers, what they are and how to use them
- Well written code

_Git_
- Nicely written, sensible commits, that are frequently made


## What to send us when you're done

When returning your solution to this test, please **zip** up the entire folder email it to us

# Good luck!

Please don't worry if you can't get everything done or in the way you would have liked. We understand working under test conditions isn't ideal.

Just make a note of everything you'd like to discuss about your work (things like what you would have done differently, things you had trouble with, etc.) and feel free to include it as part of your email back to us :)
